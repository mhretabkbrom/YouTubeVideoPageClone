    <p>This is a tutorial on “How to develop a YouTube Video Search We App/ YouTube
     Clone Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript (jQuery)”. I will go through everything from 
     
     the HTML page design, YouTube API demonstration, to all the javascript that is neede
      for the app to work. I am writing this post because I think creating an app like 
      this is one of the best ways to practice web development. It is also beneficial for 
      your resume where you might add projects like these to show off your skills & creativity.</p>
